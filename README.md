# Machine-Learning-Notes

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves teaching machines to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is the process of enabling machines to learn and improve their performance on a task by analyzing and processing large sets of data.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output for each input is known. This is used in applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and spam filtering.

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the model must find patterns and structure on its own. This is used in applications such as clustering, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.

Reinforcement learning involves training a model through trial and error, where the model receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. This is used in applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

Machine learning is used in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and transportation. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, by enabling machines to make more accurate predictions and decisions, and automate tasks that were once performed by humans.
